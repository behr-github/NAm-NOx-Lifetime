%[ PRODUCTS, PRODUCT_COEFF, REACTANTS, REACTANT_COEFF, RATE_FXN ] = READ_WRF_MECH_LINE( TLINE_IN )
%   This function takes a string that is a line from the WRF-Chem KPP .eqn
%   file and separate it into products and their coefficients, reactants
%   and their coefficients, and the rate coefficient.
%
%   PRODUCTS and REACTANTS are cell arrays of the unique products and
%   reactants detected in the reaction. Their coefficients are returned as
%   vectors the same size as the cell array.  If a chemical species shows
%   up more than once on one side of the reaction, it will only occur once
%   in PRODUCTS or REACTANTS but its coefficient will reflect how many
%   times it appeared; e.g. H2O2 --> HO + HO will return HO as the only
%   product but with a coefficient of 2. Currently, if a third body is
%   specified as M{O2} or something similar, the part in {} will be ignored
%   and it will just be returned as an M.
%
%   RATE_FXN is a function handle to the appropriate rate constant
%   function. Non-photolytic rate constants will required the input of
%   temperature (in K) and number density of air (in molec./cm^3).
%
%   The KPP is described in Damian, et al. 2002; Computers and Chemical
%   Engineering, 26, 1567, http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/WG2/GPU/KPP-sdarticle.pdf
