function [ J, species, isfixed, photo_calls ] = parse_wrf_mech( mech_name )
%PARSE_WRF_MECH Parses the specified WRF mechanism into Matlab
%   [ J, SPECIES, ISFIXED, PHOTO_CALLS ] = PARSE_WRF_MECH( 'r2smh' ) will
%   use the R2SMH mechanism developed by Azimeh Zare that builds off work
%   by Ellie Browne and other to provide a very comprehensive model of
%   alkyl nitrate NOx chemistry. Return variables are:
%
%       J: a sparse Jacobian essentially given as a cell array of anonymous
%       functions that each accept the inputs c, j, TEMP, and C_M which are
%       the concentration vector of species, the vector of photolysis rate
%       constants (see PHOTO_CALLS below), the temperature of the grid
%       cell, and the number density of air in the grid cell. These final
%       two should be scalar values.
%
%       SPECIES: a cell array of chemical names matching those in the
%       R2SMH/r2smh.spc file in the same order as given in J, that is, if
%       SPECIES{1} is 'NO' then J{1}(c, j, TEMP, C_M) will give the value
%       of d[NO]/dt.
%
%       ISFIXED: logical array that specifies which of the chemical species
%       has been explicitly set in the R2SMH mechanism to not change via
%       chemical reactions.  Usually these are species like H2O or general
%       third-body M which are controlled by meteorology, not chemistry. In
%       general, be sure to initialize a value for these.
%
%       PHOTO_CALLS: list of photolysis rate functions required, in the
%       order required. Pass to call_tuv to generate the vector j of
%       photolysis rates needed by the Jacobian.
%
%   [ ... ] = PARSE_WRF_MECH('r2smh-simple') uses a much simplified
%   mechanism focusing only on the main NOx cycle. Good for testing.
